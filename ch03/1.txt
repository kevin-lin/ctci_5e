stack A would use array indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12...
stack B would use array indices 1, 4, 7, 10, 13...
stack C would use array indices 2, 5, 8, 11, 14...

We would use indices 0, 1, and 2 to keep track of the index of the last element in each
respective stack. They would be initialized to 0, 1, and 2 respectively. When we want to
push an element onto the stack, we would look at the value at index 0, 1, or 2, increment
it by 3, then store the value at that index location. To pop, we would look at the value
at index 0, 1, or 2, retrieve the value at that index, then decrement by 3.
